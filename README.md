Welcome to my personal portfolio, where I explore minimalistic and futuristic designs through both creativity and code. Each project here represents my effort to bring concepts to life, from the initial design to the final development. Along the way, I‚Äôve continued learning and refining my skills in both design and technology, aiming to create experiences that are both visually appealing and functional. I invite you to explore my work and see how I strive to balance aesthetics with thoughtful development

üìÅ Featured Projects: 

- 3D Navigation Bar

The 3D Navigation Bar project showcases my ability to blend design innovation with interactive user experiences. In this project, users can navigate a 3D space with clickable planets, each leading to different sections or external links, offering an immersive and engaging experience.

Key Features:

- Responsive 3D Design: Smooth, animated transitions with dynamic, clickable elements (planets) that provide intuitive navigation across devices.
- Interactive User Experience: Each planet in the 3D space is clickable, redirecting users to specific content or external links for a seamless interactive journey.
- Futuristic Aesthetics: Minimalistic yet visually impactful, leveraging the latest design trends, advanced lighting, and sleek animations for a modern, high-tech feel.
