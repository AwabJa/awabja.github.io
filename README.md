A.J. Ahmed | Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio, where I explore minimalistic and futuristic designs through both creativity and code. Each project here represents my effort to bring concepts to life, from the initial design to the final development. Along the way, I‚Äôve continued learning and refining my skills in both design and technology, aiming to create experiences that are both visually appealing and functional. I invite you to explore my work and see how I strive to balance aesthetics with thoughtful development.
